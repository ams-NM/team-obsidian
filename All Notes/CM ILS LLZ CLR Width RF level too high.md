### What -[[2022-12-13 Tue]] 22:30 ~ [[2022-12-14 Wed]] 05:00
- LLZ Tx2 changed over to Tx1 due to CLR Width RF level at 120%.
- Same value of Tx1 was 115% which was at warning level.
- Call-out arrived at 10:30pm, then did some checking of cable connectors on top of LLZ cabinet.
- Tower did not allow to have the maintenance downtime before 3am due to traffic.
- When time came, entered sensitive area to check the LLZ ADU cabinet first, due to the rain happened to stop.
  - unplugged & plugged in again those cable connectors:
    - CLR CSB on ADU
    - CLR SBO on ADU
    - CLR Width ouput on MCU
- When it's about to be done, the rain started again.
- Back in LLZ station, found that CLR Width RF level of both Txs were having similar values.
- After 4 -5 minutes during preparation for power measurement, the RF levels dropped about 10%. 
- Both values were within normal.
- Then started power measurement, and the results were close to those during last month's 3-monthly PM.
- Final reading of CLR Width RF level:
  - Tx1: 103.5%
  - Tx2: 108.3%
- Alarm & warning were cleared at 4:30am.
