# Problem 
- Unlike [[Sys.ILS]], there wasn't a local port extension in TCD room.
- We had extended the local port from DVOR station to fiber rack in equipment room some day earlier. Put fiber MOXAs on both ends, and verified it worked.
- Now we need to extend it to TCD room.
## Preparation
### When
### How
1. 10 meters fiber patch is not long enough. 
2. Put the MOXA somewhere near the door, and use a LAN cable to extend RS232 wires to DVOR PC.
### What
- [x] Fiber patches - 10 meter. (Could not find a longer one on Maximo). PR: 1000018687, -[[2022-10-01 Sat]]
