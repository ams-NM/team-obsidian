582298 AWSN TCP/IP SERVICE FAILED TO CONNECT TO REMOTE HOST
- Complete
597970 NEW AWSN SWITCH TO THE RWY16 AUTOMATICALLY
- Complete
- Hard to locate the problem due to workstations with administrator login on other party(ATC, AOCC, SMG).
- It's possible that someone triggered the action mistakenly.
- That's an operation authorization issue.
- Or defect of the software from Vaisala.
- This issue hasn't shown up for a few months. It seems related parties are getting more familiar with this function of the new AWOS system.
599830 VCS BCB CARD UNSTABILE
- Complete
603371  ATIS CANNOT GENERATE & BROADCAST THE CODE THEY INPUT
- Complete

- Complete
- Move FA36 HK PC to TCD replacing old FA36 ZH.
604927  ILS-LLZ, SHUT DOWN DUE TO CLR DDM ABNORMAL.
- Complete, duplicated with 604778.
- Since it happened to the same parameter of both Tx, so the cause would most likely be on the common path of the CLR signal. Suspected that it has the same cause with CM#604778.
- The problem will be followed by CM#604778. 
- Close this duplicated CM.
