## Log
### [[2023-07-12 Wed]]
- Use a straight LAN cable to connect spare Console to VCS Core PCM30 slot 8
- A, B on the back of the Console should be connecting to the corresponding slots on VCS Core PCM30. Otherwise alarm would be activated on related JIFs.
### [[2023-07-13 Thu]]
- Found differences in cabling between new PDH and existing RAD MUXs.
	- PDH uses 1&2 for Tx, 4&5 for Rx
	- RAD uses 1&2 for Rx, 4&5 for Tx
- Need to make LAN patch cables accordingly.
- Tested fine:
	- Made calls to TCD Console
	- Received ATIS `126.4MHz` voice
