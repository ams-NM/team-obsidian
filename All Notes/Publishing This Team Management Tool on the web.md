## Ideas
### Reference:
- [Logseq Publish Official Doc](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/publishing)
- [Publish on VPS with Docker](https://devops.bike/publish-your-notes-as-site)
### Tools to use
- [[Obsidian]]
	- Pros:
		 - no need to transplant the existing content.
	- Cons:
		 - There is no easy way to publish, since it was one way of them to make money. 
- [[Logseq]]
	- Pros:
		- There are ways to publish the content. Even an official one.
		- Might be more easy to arrange tasks, since it's a block-based outliner app.
	- Cons:
		- Need to transfer all the content of this vault into [[Logseq]].
		- Set up from scratch on the workflow & templates.
### Ways to publish
- [[GitHub Pages]]
	- No need to handle domain name and ssl cert.
	- ~~Multiple GitHub accounts on same PC?~~
		- Put this into organization 'ams-NM' to solve this issue.
		- [Managing multiple accounts - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/managing-multiple-accounts)
		- [Merging multiple personal accounts - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts)
- Personal VPS
- [[Vercel]]
## Why?
- Share plans and schedules to the team
	- Since this Obsidian vault can be view and edit only by myself, there is no easy way to share it within team members.
	- Especially when I am absent at work.
