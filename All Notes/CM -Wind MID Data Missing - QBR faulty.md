## TODO:
- [ ] Install a new [[QBR]] to resume normal operation. -[[â›”Issues Pending]]
## Log:
### [[2023-05-18 Thu]]
- Installed a new [[QBR]]101C on MAWS MID, reconnected the battery. `Low battery` warning cleared.  
- The [[Obstruction Light]]  of the wind pole was failed as well. So we `replaced` it together with its broken power wire.
### [[2023-03-17 Fri]]
- The newly installed [[QBR]] was faulty as well. A strong smell came out when open the cabinet. 
- DC output was not available.
- The QBR provides 12v DC to Wind sensor, Data Logger & obstruction light.
- Bypassing the QBR, feeds a 15V DC from the existing power supply instead of the QBR as temporarily means.
- Service resumed.
## [[2023-03-16 Thu]]
- Replaced [[QBR]] with the only spare, service resumed normal.
- Data was missing again in the evening.
