- Meta data failed to update on [[Forecaster]]'s Trend template app. 
	- As was told that the data will update automatically when time is due for a meta.
- Forecaster clicked the `SEND TO OWS` which sends trend to [[Observer]], prompts `ERROR: No connection to Vaisala_msg_srv.` 
- Forecaster received no response when Observer requested a trend manually as asked.
- We tried reboot Forecaster's workstation with no luck.
- [[Observer]] handles its operation normally at the moment.
- We suspected that something was wrong with the communication of the Meta app between Observer and Forecaster.
- The same problem happened after rebooting Observer's workstation. Now Meta data did not show up on its Meta template app with the same prompt `ERROR: No connection to Vaisala_msg_srv.`  
- We found a `Vaisala Message Service` of Windows "Service" on CDUA, then restart the service.

- The Meta apps on both [[Forecaster]] & [[Observer]] resumed normal.
