# Problem 🐞
- Wind direction  [[RWY34]] has 50 degrees difference with [[RWY16]] & [[RWY MID]].
## Cause
- There is a screw which fixes the sensor to the holder.
- The screw was gone during [[Typhoon]].
## Solution
- Get a screw from a spare wind sensor to solve the problem.
### Who
- [[Aaron]], [[Joe-有哥]], [[Eric]], [[Alex]], [[👨Angus]]

## Log
- [[2022-08-26 Fri]] It was obvious that the "North" arrow on the sensor was pointing to a wrong direction, when we ascend up there to check with the [[🚚Platform Truck]].
